# Developing Underwater Networks using UnetStack

Slides for the talk given at the [Oceans Summer School](https://singapore24.oceansconference.org/ieee-oes-summer-school-2024/) on the 13th of June 2024 in Singapore.

## Key Takeaways

- Underwater networks are critical for marine exploration and research, enabling communication and data transmission in the ocean.
- Underwater networks are challenging due to the unique properties of the underwater environment, such as long propagation delays and limited bandwidth.
- UnetStack is a powerful platform for developing underwater networks, offering a range of tools and capabilities for underwater communication.
